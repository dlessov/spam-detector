# spam-detector
A Naive Bayes classifier was implemented to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using both Bag of Words (BoW) and tf-idf features. The dataset was preprocessed, removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and eliminating stop words. Evaluation metrics included accuracy (96.1%), precision (97.3%), recall (73.0%), and an F1-score (83.4%), indicating the model's high accuracy and precision. However, the lower recall suggests some spam messages might be missed. The class imbalance issue with more hams (86.6%) than spams (13.4%) could have influenced recall, and addressing this imbalance is recommended through stratified sampling or oversampling/undersampling techniques.
